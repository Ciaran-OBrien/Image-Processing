# Obtain important data; Flesh detection in different colour spaces. As the assignment was regrading skin colours, I needed to research what 
# colour space and thresholding parameters were necessary here. For this, I took the given image of the skin mole, and used a colour picker tool, 
# like Photoshop's colour picker tool, in order to obtain the RGB colours of the skin. I took 10 sample across the image and took an average of 
# these values. 
# Once I had the RGB vales, I used colorizer.org in order to obtain the HSV values for my chosen skin colour. The algorithm these values were used 
# in will be discussed below, along with the code used afterwards.
# 
# # Requirements:
# 
# - Convert the image to an appropriate colour space;
# - Enhance the image to maximise the contrast between the mole and the skin;
# - Create a binary mask of the mole from the image using thresholding or edge detection;
# - Use morphology to clean up this mask;
# - Extract the contours in the binary image;
# - Sort the contours by area to find the largest;
# - Draw this contour on the original image as a thick red line;
# 
# # Method:
# 
# My method included 3 steps:
# 
# 1. Masking
# 2. Morphological operation
# 3. FindContours
# 
# ## 1. Masking:
# 
# As mentioned in my setup, I knew that I was dealing with skin colours, so decided to make use of the HSV colour space. Using the values researched 
# form above,  min_HSV = [20, 70, 0] and max_HSV = [120, 200, 255], I was able to create a binary mask by using the inRange() fnx. 
# The inRange() fnx take two parameters, the min and max values for your colour threshold. When we pass in the HSV image, the fnx filters out any 
# other colours outside the parameter ranges, and returns a binary mask of the chosen range.This mask was returned from the getHSVMask fxn(). 
# I did look at trying to use the YCrCb range, as that has proven useful in research for skin thresholding. However, the results I obtained from HSV 
# masking we satisfactory. Further work on the mask is shown below.
# 
# ## 2. Morphological operation:
# 
# The resulting mask from getHSVMask() fnx needed some cleaning up. For this, I made use of OpenCV's morphological operations. These operations 
# alter the structure of a binary image, in our case a binary mask. I made use of two operations, closing and opening, with kernel sizes of (7,7) 
# and (3,3) respectively.
# Closing is a Dilation followed by an Erosion operation. Here missing holes in the mask, as per the result of getHSVMask(), are filled in relative 
# to the background, black.
# Opening an erosion followed by a dilation operation. Here background noise is removed relative to the kernel neighbours. The method implemented 
# in the background here is when at least one kernel neighbour has a value of 1, then the pixel element being compared as the central pixel of the 
# kernel, is set to a value of 1.
# 
# ## 3. FindContours :
# 
# The final step in my method concluded with finding the contours of the binary mask, and using a contour to draw a red line around the found mole.
# Firstly I made use of OpenCV's findContour() fnx with three parameters, the binary mask, the contour retrieval mode, and the contour approximation 
# method.
# The Binary mask has been defined as per the previous two steps in my method.
# The contour retrieval mode is defined by a set of 5 modes as per OpenCV RetrievalModes documentation. I chose to use the RETR_LIST mode as it 
# simply retrieves all the available contours and can be easily accessed just like a regular list. This will be useful, as I am required to sort 
# the contours too.
# The contour approximation mode is defined by a set of 5 modes as per OpenCV ContourApproximationModes documentation. I chose to use the 
# CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE mode as it attempts to filter out false positive contours by compressing horizontal, vertical, and diagonal segments and 
# leaves only their end points. However CHAIN_APPROX_NONE, which simply returns all contours found, returns the same number of contours, so either 
# mode works.
# 
# As the contours are returned as a list, I can easily perform the required task of sorting them according to area size. I did this through the use 
# of python's sorted fnx, which takes the list, the sorting key, and order as parameter.
# The lists has been defined as the contours lits earlier
# The sorting key, I use the area of the contours themselves, using cv2.contourArea.
# The order, I set the reversOrder to True, so simply the first element in the list is the largest contours, therefore the contour of the mole.
# 
# # Testing:
# 
# ## Error checking: 
# Error checking occurs when we try to convert an image into HSV. As we can only safely say if an image has 2/3 channels, I built the error 
# checking based around that. If the user selects a 2 channle input, an error will be raised. 
# 
# ## Image Testing: 
# Of the two images provided, my current method unfortunately works with one of the images. This is due to the fine tunig required for the 
# getMorphologyMask() fnx. Hower, I have added an extra image found online that works with my method.
