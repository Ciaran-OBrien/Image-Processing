# Sample Project Work
## Where's Wally

This assignment was one of the more fun and enganging assignments as part of the course. The task was simply, build a script that could automatically find the character _Waldo_ from the _Where's Wally_ series.

The implementation of this assignment was quite tough as we were limited to using pure image-processing techniques. Any external libray outside of [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy), [openCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv), and [mathplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) where subject to approval by the lecturer.

## Skin Cancer Segmentation

This assesment was difficult on two fronts; we had to identify and hightlight cancerous looking moles, withlimited time to complete the task.

I approached this task by quickly reseraching the domiannt characteristics of a cancerous mole and found them to be: it's size, colour, and amount protruding from the skin. Bar the latter, I could compute these characteristics using comupter vision, given the provided test images looking straight down on a person's skin.
